"""List a user's import sources and resolve a source into full Track objects.

Two source kinds:
  - "likes"      → the user's «Мне нравится» (``users_likes_tracks``), which has no
                   ``kind`` so it is exposed as a synthetic source.
  - {"kind": N}  → a regular user playlist (``users_playlists``).

``resolve_tracks`` returns *full* ``Track`` objects (batched via ``client.tracks``)
so the downloader has download-info + metadata in hand.
