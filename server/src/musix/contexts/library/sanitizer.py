"""Strip provider artifacts from lyrics at ingestion. Pure stdlib.

Lyrics arrive from several places — the file's own tags (often written by the
Yandex import downloader), lyrics.ovh, and the syncedlyrics provider chain —
and every one of them mixes non-lyric text into the payload. Cleaning it once,
here, is worth far more than cleaning it in each consumer: the stored text is
what the dense vectors encode, what the player renders, what the track chat
reads and what the gems pipeline mines.

Measured on the 2026-07-26 production snapshot (5474 tracks with lyrics in the
main library):

  1115  bare ``\\r`` line separators   (20%)
   112  CJK credit headers            ("作词 : Billie Joe Armstrong/Mike Dirnt")
    91  ``[mm:ss.xx]`` timestamps

The newline case is the one that hurts most and is least visible: the player
does ``lyrics.split('\\n')``, so a fifth of the library rendered as a single
unbroken paragraph. It is also a prerequisite for the other two rules — you
cannot drop a credit *line* or a leading timestamp in text that has no lines.
