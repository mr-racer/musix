"""Code gates over the LLM's classified links: the model decides, code carries.

The 2026-07-26 production audit found 2977 "samples" and 634 "sampled_by"
rows, the great majority of them wrong. Four failure shapes accounted for
almost all of it, and every one of them is decidable without a model:

- an artist "sampling" themselves — 170 of 2977 and 91 of 634 rows
  (``kanye-west/Bound 2`` (2013) was "sampled by" Kanye's own *Illest
  Motherfucker Alive* (2011));
- a link to a track on the very same album (``the-weeknd/Hardest to Love``
  "sampled by" *After Hours*);
- a source that came out later than the song that supposedly used it;
- the same pair claimed in both directions at once.

So the LLM is asked only what it is good at — *what kind* of link is this —
and everything checkable is checked here. Every rejection carries a reason so
the dry-run report can show why a link disappeared.
