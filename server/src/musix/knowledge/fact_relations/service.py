"""Pipeline entry point: raw facts -> GLiNER2 -> LLM classifier -> gates -> DB.

**Production uses the producer leg only.** Sampling links are owned by the
facts_v2 pipeline (``ai_tasks/refined_facts._store_links``), which labels a
fact before reading it instead of matching a lexicon, and cleans its output
through ``facts_v2.sample_links``. :func:`process_song_facts` therefore calls
:func:`collect_claims` with ``samples=False``. The sampling stages below still
exist for ``scripts/dry_run_relations.py``, which reports what this extractor
would have said; nothing writes them.

Four stages, in order of how much they cost:

1. **Lexical prefilter** (:mod:`gates`). A fact is read for samples only if it
   says in words that sound was taken. On the 2026-07-26 snapshot this alone
   removes the whole Adele/"Hello" family — *"the first line matches the
   melody of Lionel Richie's…"* — before any triage runs. It guards the sample
   leg only: producers are a separate feature and keep their old behaviour.
2. **GLiNER2 + triage** find candidate spans and split them into AS_IS
   (explicit wording) and LLM (needs a decision).
3. **The LLM classifies, it does not confirm.** It answers *what kind of link
   is this* from a closed list — sample, interpolation, cover, remix,
   lyrical_reference, inspiration, other. Asking a 12B model "should this be
   included?" was the old design and it drowned; asking "what is it?" is a
   question with a checkable answer.
4. **Code gates** (:func:`gates.apply_gates`) drop what is decidable without a
   model: self-references, same-album links, impossible release order,
   contradictory directions, duplicates, and anything past the per-song cap.

Claims accumulate across ALL of a song's facts and are gated once at the end —
the cap and the both-directions check are only meaningful over the whole set.

Both GLiNER2 and the LLM are optional in practice: a per-fact extractor
failure is logged and that fact is skipped; a failing/unavailable LLM degrades
to AS_IS-only for that fact. Nothing here raises out to the caller.
