"""LLM leg of the producers/samples relation extraction.

Builds the chat messages for an OpenAI-compatible LLM call over one fact, parses the
strict-JSON reply and merges replies across a song's facts. The NER markers that GLiNER2
used to put in the fact were removed with it (2026-10-01); see ``service``.

The system prompt below is taken verbatim from
``.superpowers/sdd/reference_llm_re_test.py``, where it was validated on 50
production facts (100% valid JSON on gemma-12b), plus four extra trap rules
(8-11) added for this task; the sentences about NER markers went with GLiNER2. Pure
``re`` + ``json`` + stdlib.

SYSTEM = """You read ONE fact about a KNOWN subject song and label how it links that song to other music.

Return ONLY a JSON object, no explanations, exactly this shape:
{"producers": ["name", ...], "links": [{"song": "title or null", "artist": "name or null", "direction": "source|usage", "relation": "sample|interpolation|cover|remix|lyrical_reference|inspiration|other"}, ...]}

"producers": people or teams the fact EXPLICITLY credits as producer or co-producer of the subject song (or of the album containing it).

"links": one entry per OTHER musical work the fact connects to the subject song.

"direction" — which side took from which:
- "source": the other work is the older one and the SUBJECT took from it.
- "usage": the other work is the newer one and IT took from the subject.

"relation" — pick exactly one, and do not stretch the first two:
- "sample": part of the other recording's AUDIO is used.
- "interpolation": the other work's melody or part is re-played or re-sung.
- "cover": one is a cover or a version of the other.
- "remix": one is a remix, edit or live version of the other.
- "lyrical_reference": the lyrics only mention, quote, allude to or diss it. No sound was taken.
- "inspiration": "inspired by", "reminiscent of", "matches the melody of", "tribute to", "in the style of".
- "other": anything else, including lawsuits and accusations of copying.

Rules you MUST follow:
1. "sample" and "interpolation" require the fact to SAY that sound was taken. If it describes a mention in the lyrics, a diss, a resemblance, a homage or a legal claim, use the label that fits — never "sample".
2. Facts beginning with "Lyrics string:" are annotations explaining a LINE. Default to "lyrical_reference" unless the same fact explicitly states the audio was sampled or interpolated.
3. If the fact links two OTHER works and the subject song is neither side, output nothing for it.
4. Never invent names or titles that are not written in the fact. If the artist is named but the song is not, use null for "song"; if a PERSON's voice is sampled with no song named, that is {"song": null, "artist": person} — never put a person's name into "song".
5. Writers, co-writers, featured artists, engineers, DJs and remixers are NOT producers. Only explicit producing counts ("produced by X", "X produced/co-produced", "production by X", "X handled production").
6. A person appears in "producers" at most once; use the fullest form of the name written in the fact.
7. "used the same sample as" another song is not a link of the subject song.
8. When nothing qualifies, return empty arrays. Output must be valid JSON."""
