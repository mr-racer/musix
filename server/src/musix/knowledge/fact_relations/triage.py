"""Pure-Python triage over GLiNER2 raw extraction output for one fact.

Buckets each candidate producer/sample relation into:

- ``AS_IS``: confident enough to write straight to the DB
- ``LLM``: needs LLM confirmation before it's trusted

This is a 1-to-1 port of the validated triage rules from the offline
validation script (``.superpowers/sdd/reference_gliner_triage.py``), adapted
to take the subject song's title/artist as parameters instead of looking them
up from a global ``song_meta`` dict keyed by slug. No torch/gliner2/sqlite
imports here -- pure ``re`` + stdlib.
