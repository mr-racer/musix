"""What the sample gates need to know about the user's own tracks.

A claimed link is only checkable when the other side is something we actually
hold — that is 275 of 2977 links on the 2026-07-26 production snapshot (9%).
This index is what turns "Kanye West — Jesus Walks" in a fact into a year, an
album and a ``songs.slug``.

One deliberate choice: :meth:`resolve` reports the **earliest** year among all
library copies of a title. Library ``year`` is the year of the *copy*, not of
the recording — the same snapshot has Bee Gees' "Stayin' Alive" at 2017, ABBA's
"Dancing Queen" at 2012 and Michael Jackson's "Billie Jean" at 2008, all from
compilations. Taking the minimum is what keeps a remaster from making a real
sample look like a time-travelling one.
