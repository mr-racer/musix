"""Classify a batch of raw facts, then rewrite each kept one on its own.

Two stages, and the split is the point. Sorting is not selecting: a batch of
six facts asked "which label does each of these carry" leaves none of them
competing for a slot, so nothing gets crowded out — which is exactly what the
old five-at-a-time "pick the interesting ones" prompt did. Rewriting IS a
per-fact job, so it gets one call per fact, with the prompt chosen by label.

Measured against the previous pipeline on the same 1199 production facts:
620 facts reach text instead of 511, `other` on the artist side falls from
45.2% to 27.8%, answers in the wrong language from 4.5% to zero, and hard JSON
failures from 6 to 1.

    Three rules, each of which cost real data when it was absent.

    `sample` is ORTHOGONAL: it produces a row in ``sample_links``, not prose, so

    the sample branch threw the creation story away entirely — seven times in a

    and took different prompts purely because of the order the model listed them.

    An OFF-SCOPE note is set aside, never relocated. The pipeline used to carry
    a fact to the other page, and the destination has no room for what the fact
    was anchored to: the rewrite for an artist page is given no song title, so
    "Geri plays on this track" arrived on the band's page still saying "this
    track", pointing at nothing. Measured on the production run, 1968 of 4880

    231 of Kanye West's 245 — and the class they landed in was overwhelmingly
