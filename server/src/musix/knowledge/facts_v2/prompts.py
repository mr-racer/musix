SONG_CLASSIFY = """You sort raw notes about ONE song into labels. You do not rewrite them.

The song is "{title}" by {artist}.

Two kinds of note arrive here. Some are editorial entries from a song database.
Some are fan notes written next to a single lyric line, and they look like
`Line: "..." | Note: ...`. For a fan note you judge WHAT THE NOTE CLAIMS, never
the lyric line it hangs on: a note quoting a striking line and then explaining
what it means carries no fact at all.

A note earns a real label only if it is about THIS song. A note about a
different song, or about nothing in particular, is "other".

NEVER A FACT

Read this list FIRST, before you reach for a label. When everything a note
carries is one of these, the answer is "other" — however specific it sounds and
whatever else it resembles. It applies to the WHOLE note: one real fact buried
in three sentences of this is still that fact, and it keeps its label.

  a. what a lyric means, what an image stands for, who a line is aimed at, or a
     translation of a line — unless the phrase being explained is the TITLE,
     which is "title_origin" however figurative the explanation gets;
  b. a nickname, an alias or a slang word merely explained, with no story of
     where it came from;
  c. praise, an opinion, or a critic's verdict, with nothing checkable in it;
  d. a chart position, a release date, a sales figure or a certification
     standing on its own — but a superlative built on one is a real fact and
     not this: first, only, oldest, youngest, longest, biggest, best-selling,
     or a previous record it beat;
  e. a concert, a tour date or a television appearance merely mentioned, with
     nothing happening in it;
  f. where somebody was born, grew up or went to school, on its own;
  g. anything whose SUBJECT is a different song, a different recording, or a
     person who had nothing to do with this one. Judge the subject, not the
     cast: a note about this song that also names other people is still about
     this song.

LABELS

"sample" — the recording contains a sample or an interpolation of another
recording, or another recording sampled this one. Sound only. Lyrics that quote
another song's words are not a sample. A producer credit is not a sample.
  · "The drum break is lifted from The Winstons' 'Amen, Brother'." → sample
  · "He raps the same line Nas used on 'The World Is Yours'." → other

"video" — the music video for THIS song: who directed it, how and where it was
shot, what happens in it, how it was received. A record sleeve, a live
performance and an awards-show appearance are not music videos, and neither is
another song's video.
  · "Shot in one take on a Steadicam in an abandoned hospital." → video
  · "He opened the 2024 MTV Video Music Awards with it." → other

"creation" — how the song came to exist: writing, recording, studio incidents,
who it was written for, why it was released the way it was, and what the people
who made it have said about making it.

"title_origin" — where the song's TITLE comes from: a person, a place, a work,
a phrase, a word's meaning. This is about the title itself, not about what the
lyrics are about.
  · "Named after the German physicist Georg Simon Ohm; an ohm is the unit of
     electrical resistance." → title_origin
  · "The song is about resisting a manipulative ex." → other

"trouble" — a lawsuit, a plagiarism claim, a ban, a withdrawal, a formal
complaint, a boycott, over THIS song.

"about_artist" — the note's subject is the artist's own life or career, and this
song is only where the note happens to sit.

"sound" — how the record SOUNDS and how that was achieved: instruments, playing
technique, arrangement, production choices, time signature, vocal treatment.
The test: the note must explain a moment you could go and HEAR. A note that
still makes sense with the sound muted is not "sound".
  · "Jonny Greenwood ran the guitar through an Ondes Martenot, which gives the
     wavering high line in the chorus." → sound
  · "Critics called the production the finest of the decade." → other

"placement" — where THIS recording has been heard OUTSIDE its own release:
films, television, series, video games, adverts, sports broadcasts, political
campaigns. Somebody else's recording of the song is not this label, and neither
is the act playing it themselves on a stage or a show.
  · "Rockstar licensed it for a radio station in Grand Theft Auto V." → placement
  · "She sang it at a surprise street show in New Orleans." → other

"record" — an award this song won, a record it holds, or a first it achieved.
A CHART feat counts only with a superlative — first, only, oldest, youngest,
longest, biggest, best-selling — or the previous record it beat. A chart number
on its own is never a record; an award needs no superlative at all.
  · "Its debut at #42 made 98-year-old Marjorie Grande the oldest credited
     artist ever to appear on the Hot 100." → record
  · "It reached number 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 and went platinum." → other

"other" — everything on the NEVER A FACT list, and everything else that is left.
It is the honest answer far more often than any label above.
  · "The 'heart' is a symbol of determination, so he is saying he is still
     resilient." → other
  · "It was covered by Brenda Lee and by Hall & Oates." → other

A note may carry more than one label — "sample" and "sound" often travel
together. "other" never combines with anything.

EXAMPLES

Notes:
M1. The bassline is a slowed-down loop of Chic's "Good Times".
M2. Line: "I'm the king of pain" | Note: He feels that his suffering defines him, and the crown is an ironic one.
M3. Recorded in a single night in a Hollywood garage after their gear was stolen.
M4. Bono has won 22 Grammy Awards across his career.
M5. Line: "Two for no" | Note: A way of communicating used by patients with locked-in syndrome, the illness portrayed in the film The Diving Bell and the Butterfly.
M6. The title comes from the Magnolia Projects in New Orleans, the housing project where the rapper grew up.
M7. Line: "Young Hov' in the house" | Note: Hov is one of his nicknames, short for Jehovah.
M8. He performed the song at Glastonbury in 2008 and again at Coachella.

ARTIST_CLASSIFY = """You sort raw notes about ONE artist into labels. You do not rewrite them.

The artist is {artist}.

A note earns a real label only if it is about this artist. A note about somebody
else, or about nothing in particular, is "other". "This artist" means the person or
group named above, and the people IN that group. Not a guest, not a producer,
not a relative, not another artist they mention.

NEVER A FACT

Read this list FIRST, before you reach for a label. When everything a note
carries is one of these, the answer is "other" — however specific it sounds and
whatever else it resembles. It applies to the WHOLE note: one real fact buried

  f. where somebody was born, grew up or went to school, on its own;
  g. anything whose SUBJECT is a person outside this act — a guest, a producer,
     another artist. Somebody who plays IN this group is not an outsider, and
     neither is what happened to them. Judge the subject, not the cast: a note
     about this artist that also names other people is still about this artist.

LABELS

"about_song" — the note is really about ONE named song by this artist: how it
was made, what it samples, its video, where it has been heard. The song must be
the note's SUBJECT, not a passing mention.

"award" — a Grammy, a chart record, a hall-of-fame induction, a national or
festival prize, or a notable anti-prize. A gold or platinum certification on its
own is not an award; a chart position on its own is not a chart record.

"band_history" — how the group formed, split, reformed, changed members, moved
city, signed or left a label; the events that make up the group's story.
It is about the GROUP. A thing that happened to one person, and would still be
worth telling if the group did not exist, is "personal". The making of one
particular song is neither: that is "about_song".

"personal" — a concrete, specific thing about the PERSON behind the music: a job
they did before music, an illness or diagnosis, an arrest or conviction, a
tattoo and how they got it, military service, a phobia, a collection, a family
tie, a near-miss that changed their life. It must carry a specific detail or a
story, and it must be about the artist named above — a note this concrete about
somebody else is still "other". A taste, a preference, a diet or a compliment is
not this.
  · "He tattooed O,Z,Z,Y across his own knuckles with a needle and graphite
     while in jail for burglary." → personal
  · "He spent nine years in the Navy, where speech therapy cured his stutter,
     then wrote songs while delivering milk." → personal
  · "Cuomo has a thing for female newscasters." → other
  · "Ariana Grande is a vegan and loves animals more than most people." → other

"name_origin" — where the name this artist RECORDS UNDER came from, and who
chose it. An alter ego, a nickname, or a name another artist goes by is not this
label, and neither is how the name is pronounced.
  · "Mike Kroeger handed back change at Starbucks saying 'here's your nickel
     back', and the band took it." → name_origin
  · "One of his nicknames is Hova, short for Jehovah." → other

"sound" — the artist's signature sound and how it is made: instruments,
production habits, arrangement tics, vocal approach, influences on their style.
The test: the note must be about THE MUSIC — how they make it, or how it comes
out. A remark about luck, character, ambition or what a lyric means is not.
A life event that later fed into a record is "personal", not "sound".
  · "She sings the chords to her co-writers instead of playing them, because she
     plays no instrument." → sound
  · "Fans call him the hardest-working man in the studio." → other

"other" — everything on the NEVER A FACT list, and everything else that is left:
plain discography chronology with nothing behind it, and a bare roster or
release listing with no event in it. It is the honest answer often.

A note may carry more than one label. "other" never combines with anything.

EXAMPLES

Notes:
M1. The band is named after the spiral galaxy M83.
M2. Bellamy wanted to be in a classical or jazz band and set out to learn jazz piano.
M3. "Lonely Boy" got its video by accident: they scrapped the shoot and kept an hour of Derrick Tuggle dancing.
M4. Formed in Antibes in 2001 by Anthony Gonzalez and Nicolas Fromageau; Fromageau left after the second album.
M5. At 21, after his band broke up and his girlfriend left him, he drank furniture polish in a suicide attempt.
M6. 1979- Paul Dean Guitar, vocals 1979- Doug Johnson Keyboards 1979- Mike Reno Lead vocals
M7. GLC started rapping to get through the death of his parents in a car crash.
M8. The album reached number one in Belgium and Israel and was certified gold.
