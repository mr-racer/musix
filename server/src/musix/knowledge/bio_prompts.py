BIO_PROMPT = """You write the biography paragraph shown on an artist's page in a
music player. Everything you may use is in the PASSAGES below; they come from
that artist's Wikipedia article.

CRITICAL RULE — NAMES. The artist is written exactly "{artist}". Copy that
spelling character for character wherever it appears. Names of other people,
bands, albums, songs, films, labels and brands also keep the script the passages
use: a name in Latin letters stays in Latin letters, undeclined. Countries and
cities are ordinary words — translate those.

WHAT TO WRITE

Two short blocks in {lang}, separated by a blank line.

1. Who they are: where they came from, when they started, what they play, and
   what they are best known for. Three or four sentences, each anchored to
   something — a date, a place, a record that changed things. A string of genre
   names is not an anchor.
2. One thing out of the passages that shows what these people are like: an
   incident, a habit, a way of working, a refusal, a contradiction. Two
   sentences at most, and begin with the thing itself.
   A sales figure, a chart run, a label change and a list of awards are NOT
   this. They are statistics; block 1 already carries the ones that matter.
   If the passages hold nothing like this, leave the block out entirely rather
   than padding it.

RULES

- Every fact, name, date and number must come from the PASSAGES. If they do not
  say where the artist was born, you do not say it. Inventing a death, a
  break-up or an award is the worst failure possible here.
- If the passages say the artist has died or the band has split, write in the
  past tense. If they are active, write in the present.
- No opening filler, no "по данным Википедии", no source line — the interface
  shows the source itself.
- Do not list a discography. A year matters only when something happened in it.
- NEVER announce a fact before stating it, and never say who would find it
  striking. Announcing costs a sentence and tells the reader nothing.
- A sentence that stays true when another artist's name is put in it is not
  worth its space. Cut it and write what only these people did.

EXAMPLES

The second block, done right and done wrong on the same material. These are
written in Russian; write yours in {lang}.

  RIGHT: Гитару May собрал вместе с отцом из старой каминной полки, а вместо
  медиатора берёт монету в шесть пенсов — зазубренный край даёт тот скрежет,
  по которому группу и узнают.
  WRONG: Особое внимание слушателей привлекает то, что May использует
  необычный плектр.

  RIGHT: Rumours они записывали, расставаясь друг с другом прямо по ходу
  сессий, — и ссоры уходили в тексты песен, которые пели друг другу же.
  WRONG: Альбом разошёлся тиражом в сорок миллионов и взял «Грэмми» как
  альбом года.

The first WRONG spends its sentence introducing the fact instead of telling it,
and what is left would fit any band. The second is a statistic: true, specific,
and it says nothing about what these people are like.

PASSAGES

{passages}

If the passages turn out to be about somebody else, or say nothing that
identifies this artist, answer with exactly NO_DATA and nothing else. Do not
explain what is missing — an empty page beats a paragraph about the gap.

Write the biography now. Plain text, no headings, no markdown other than a blank
line between the two blocks. Names spelled in Latin letters stay in Latin."""


LANG_RETRY = """ЯЗЫК ОТВЕТА — РУССКИЙ. Ты уже один раз написал этот текст
по-английски. Весь текст, каждое предложение, пишется по-русски. По-английски
остаются ТОЛЬКО имена людей, групп, песен, альбомов и фильмов.

"""


FACET_QUERIES_PROMPT = """You are writing SEARCH QUERIES that will be run against
the text of {artist}'s biography — an encyclopedia article, or the pages a web
search returned about them. The text is already downloaded; nothing you write
goes to a search engine.

For each of the four topics below, write 2 short queries that would match the
sentence carrying the answer. Vary the WORDS, not the topic: the retriever
already has the topic's own phrasing, so a query that repeats it adds nothing.

  topic: "the year and place the band was formed or the artist began"
  GOOD:  ["formed in", "origins and early years of the group"]
  BAD:   ["the year the band was formed", "when was the band formed"]

The GOOD pair works because articles say "was formed in Antibes in 1999" and
head a section "Origins" — neither contains the word "year". The BAD pair is the
topic said twice.

Write the queries in {lang}, the language the text is written in. Keep each
under eight words. Names of people and bands stay exactly as spelled here.

FACET_PROMPTS = {
    "grammy": """From the PASSAGES below, how many Grammy Awards has {artist} WON,
and how many nominations have they received? Count awards to the artist and to
their songs and albums alike.

Answer only from the passages. If they do not state a number, that number is
null — an artist with no Grammy is the normal case, and guessing one is worse
than saying nothing. "Nominated for three" is nominations=3, wins=null, not
wins=3.

    "formed": """From the PASSAGES below, in what YEAR and in what PLACE was

Answer only from the passages. A year you cannot find is null. A first album is
not a formation date unless the passages say so.

    "name_origin": """From the PASSAGES below, where does the name "{artist}" come
from, and who chose it?

An origin is often stated obliquely — as an inspiration, a decision, or a thing
the name was taken from. All of those are origins. Only answer null when the
passages say nothing at all about where the name came from.

  passage: "Once the members came together, they settled on the name Franz
  Ferdinand. The name was originally inspired by a racehorse called Archduke
  Ferdinand. After seeing the horse win the Northumberland Plate in 2001, the
  band began to discuss Archduke Franz Ferdinand and thought it would be a good
  band name because of the alliteration."
  → {{"origin": "Название пришло от скаковой лошади Archduke Ferdinand: увидев её победу на Northumberland Plate в 2001-м, музыканты заговорили об эрцгерцоге и оценили аллитерацию.", "evidence": "The name was originally inspired by a racehorse called Archduke Ferdinand."}}

  passage: "M83 is a French electronic group formed in Antibes in 1999.
  Initially a duo of multi-instrumentalists Nicolas Fromageau and Anthony
  Gonzalez…"
  → {{"origin": null, "evidence": null}}

Do not reason about what the words of the name might mean on their own. If the
members disagree about it, that disagreement is the answer.

Write `origin` in {lang}, one sentence, at most 200 characters. Names of people,
places, works and brands stay in the script the passages use.

status is one of:
  "active"    — still working
  "disbanded" — the band has split up

  "deceased"  — the artist has died

Answer only from the passages. Anything they do not state is null. `to` stays
null while the artist is still active.
