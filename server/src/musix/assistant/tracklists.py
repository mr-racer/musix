"""Getting track references off a page: structure first, model last.

Three paths, chosen by what the page actually is:

1. **Apple Music** — ``apple_music.parse_apple_playlist`` reads the page's own
   embedded JSON. Positions, artists, albums, durations, ids. No model, no
   ambiguity. Only Apple's OWN material is accepted: an Apple-curated list is a
   professionally assembled answer to "2000s club hits", a stranger's public
   playlist is noise with the same URL shape.
2. **Wikipedia / Fandom** — markdown tables, read by column header. This is what
   replaces line-by-line heuristics: the old approach looked at a line, found a
   dash and guessed which side was the artist, so it fired on prose, on
   navigation menus and on discography footers, and could not tell a 2005 release
   year from a track number. Reading the header row and taking only rows from
   tables that have such a column is not a better guess — it is not a guess.
3. **Everything else** — prose and listicles, where there is no structure and
   judgement is genuinely needed. That is the model's job.

Why not hand a soundtrack page to the model instead: a big game's soundtrack is
two hundred rows, and a 12b model asked to transcribe that will sample a couple
of dozen and quietly drop the rest, so the intersection with the library comes
out empty. Tables are structure — parse them as structure.

The rule that makes path 3 safe: a title the model produced is a CLAIM. It
becomes a track only after ``LibraryCatalog`` matches it against the library. A
hallucinated title matches nothing and disappears.
