"""Context-aware chunking of a markdown page.

Three rules, in order of importance:

1. **A chunk never loses where it came from.** The heading path is prepended to
   the text that gets embedded, so a paragraph under
   "Kanye West > Controversies > 2009 VMA incident" carries that meaning into the
   vector. A bare paragraph about "the interruption" matches nothing.
2. **A block is never split.** A paragraph, a list, a table and a fenced code
   block are indivisible; a table cut in half is worse than useless, because the
   half without the header row looks like prose.
3. **Micro-sections are glued to their neighbour.** A two-line section under the
   same parent produces a chunk that is mostly heading; merged, it produces
   context.

Only when a single block is longer than the budget does it get cut, and then on
sentence boundaries — except for tables, which are cut by rows with the header
repeated.
