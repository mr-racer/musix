"""Progress events, in the shape the NDJSON stream already speaks.

``routes/assistant.py`` ships ``{"type": "status", "stage": ..., "human": ...,
**fields}`` lines and ``service.EventSink`` is what normalises them. This is the
producer side: the pipeline calls ``put("fetch", count=3)`` and the frame lands
in that queue, hopping back onto the event loop when the caller is a worker
thread (most of the search phase runs through ``asyncio.to_thread``).

``history`` keeps every frame. The runs are short and the frames are small, so
there is nothing to bound, and after a run it is the one place that says what
actually happened in what order.
