"""Contracts every stage of the assistant passes to the next.

Plain dataclasses on purpose: they cross a thread boundary (model calls run in
``asyncio.to_thread``), and none of them is validated at an API edge — the
route maps them onto the Pydantic models in ``app/domain/models.py`` on the way
out. Pydantic here would buy nothing and would put validation in the middle of
a pipeline instead of at its edge.

Everything the LLM produces lands in one of these only AFTER the validators in
``planner`` and ``tracklists`` have been over it. A field on a dataclass here
means "code has checked this", not "the model said so".
