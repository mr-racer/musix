"""Turning one LLM call into a plan code is willing to execute.

The model reads the sentence — that is the one thing it is better at than any
rule we could write. Everything it hands back is then checked, and anything that
cannot be traced to the user's own words is dropped.

The rules, and what each is defending against:

* **intent** must be one of four words, or the run stops and asks. A wrong branch
  costs the user a whole pipeline; a question costs a second.
* **audio_search needs a real description of sound.** The model reaches for that
  branch on "лучшие песни Sade" too, and CLAP has no vector for "best". When the
  style does not survive validation the intent is downgraded to ``playlist`` by
  code, not by asking again.
* **era** is parsed into a pair of integers and sanity-bounded. "1990-1999" is a
  filter; "the nineties" is a string that silently matches nothing.
* **style** must appear in the user's own sentence, folded. This is the rule that
  makes "extract AS IS, do not invent" checkable instead of hopeful — the model
  reliably offers "energetic" for a request that never mentioned mood.
* **the artist never enters ``ce_query`` on a lyrics search.** A name in the
  cross-encoder pair pulls the score towards every text by that artist instead of
  towards the line, and the model puts it there about half the time despite being
  told not to. Stripped in code.
* **queries** are deduplicated and capped. A model that returns the same query
  twice would otherwise spend two searches on one.
