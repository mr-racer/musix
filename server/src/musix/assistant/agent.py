"""The assistant itself: one plan, four branches, every stop decided by code.

The model is called at known points — plan, answer/extract, triage, curate — and
everything between those calls is code. There is no loop the model can steer, no
tool it can decide to reach for, and no place where "should I keep going?" is
settled by prose.

This module owns construction and dispatch and nothing else. Each branch is
readable on its own; what they share lives in ``branches/base.py``.

One instance per user message. The budgets (searches, iterations, pages) live on
the instance, so reusing one across turns would silently hand the second question
a spent budget.
