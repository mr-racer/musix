"""Collapsing near-duplicate passages out of a context pack.

The failure this exists for: ask about an artist and the open web returns the
same syndicated bio on five hosts. Every copy scores alike because every copy IS
alike, so the ranked top-10 is one paragraph repeated five times, and the model
is handed five slots that say one thing.

Exact copies are already gone by the time anything gets here — the pipeline
hashes chunk bodies at index time. What survives that is the interesting case:
the same text with a citation marker stripped, a date written the other way
round, one sentence more.

**This never deletes anything.** It runs over the ranked candidates for ONE
question and decides which of them go in front of the model this time. A passage
dropped here is still in the index, still retrievable, and the next question may
well pick it. That is the whole answer to "what if it collapses things it should
not" — the blast radius is one context pack.

The second guard is the rule itself: a pair is a duplicate only when EVERY
signal that has an opinion says so, and the signals fail differently. Dense
embeddings read meaning, so two paragraphs about the same event look nearly
identical to them even when one carries a fact the other lacks. Learned-sparse
reads (expanded) terms, so it separates them again. Requiring both to agree
means neither model's characteristic mistake can drop a passage on its own.

Nothing here imports torch: the caller hands in similarity matrices as plain
lists, which is also what makes the policy testable without a GPU.
