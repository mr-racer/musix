"""BM25 Okapi over a small in-memory corpus.

Written out rather than pulled from ``rank_bm25``: the corpus here is tens to a
few hundred short documents, the algorithm is thirty lines, and this codebase
already carries two other hand-written BM25s (``catalog_search_service._bm25f``
and the one in ``facts_retrieval``) for the same reason.

No transliteration variants and no pseudo-relevance feedback. Both exist in
``app/services/facts_retrieval.py`` to paper over one problem — a Russian query
scoring zero against English documents when BM25 was the only lexical signal. It
is no longer the only one: the learned-sparse leg is multilingual and sits next
to it at more than three times the weight. What is left for BM25 is what it is
genuinely good at — exact names, numbers and titles.
