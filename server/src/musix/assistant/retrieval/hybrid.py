"""Index a list of strings once, then rank it against any number of queries.

Building the index is the expensive half (two model passes over every document),
so a caller that will ask several questions of the same corpus should build one
retriever and reuse it — which is exactly what the assistant's web branch does
across iterations.

Nothing here reads configuration: ``alpha`` and the fusion weights arrive as
arguments. That keeps this package free of the assistant's config module, which
would otherwise be an import cycle (the assistant imports retrieval).
