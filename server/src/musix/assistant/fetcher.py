"""Downloading pages: caching, concurrency, and never raising.

``resources/web_fetch`` is the engine — a cascade of fetchers and a table-aware
extractor. This adds the three things a pipeline needs and a bare function does
not: a cache keyed by canonical URL, bounded concurrency with a hard deadline,
and the promise that one dead URL costs one page rather than the run.

Never raising matters more than it sounds. ``fetch_html`` raises when every
fetcher refuses, which is correct for a caller that wants to know — and wrong
here, where the correct response is to read the next candidate instead.
