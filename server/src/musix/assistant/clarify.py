"""Expanding an abbreviation before it reaches a search box.

"музыка из GTA 5" has to become "Grand Theft Auto V" or the search returns forum
threads. Three sources of truth, in increasing cost and decreasing availability:

1. **The model's own guess.** Free, usually right for famous titles, and
   occasionally confidently wrong ("TDU 2" → "Touring Drive Unlimited 2").
2. **The user.** Authoritative, but costs a round trip — so it is a policy, not a
   default, and the streaming route is the only place it can even be offered.
3. **Wikipedia's article title.** The article for "GTA 5" is titled "Grand Theft
   Auto V". That is a curated redirect graph doing the disambiguation work, and
   it is one search away.

When all three come up empty the run stops and says so, rather than searching for
the abbreviation and pretending the results mean anything.
