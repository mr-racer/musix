"""Retrieval over the raw facts of ONE subject.

What differs from ``app/services/facts_retrieval.py``, and why:

* **No Qdrant.** The candidate pool is every raw fact of the subject — the song
  and its artist — read straight from SQLite. A vector index earns its keep when
  you search a pool you cannot hold in memory; eighty short texts is not that
  pool. Dropping it also drops a whole class of failure (a stale index, a cold
  index, an index built by a different embedding model).
* **Nothing is filtered before ranking.** No minimum fact length, no cropping to
  N characters. Short stubs cost one slot in a batch encode and the cross-encoder
  is perfectly able to score them low.
* **Selection is by threshold, not by count.** Everything above ``min_prob`` goes
  to the model. That makes the threshold the single thing to tune, and the size
  of what passes is logged on every call so the effect is visible rather than
  assumed.
* **No pseudo-relevance feedback.** It existed to give BM25 something to match on
  when the query was Russian and the facts English. The learned-sparse leg does
  that job now.

``artist_facts`` and ``song_facts`` are a SHARED pool keyed by slug — the same
real-world artist has the same facts for everyone — and ``fact_visibility`` is
what makes them per-account. The join is applied here even though the subject was
already resolved out of this library: it costs one index lookup, and per-account
isolation is the invariant this codebase treats as load-bearing.
