"""What the user actually owns, in memory, indexed for matching.

Deliberately SQLite and not Qdrant. The paths this replaces both went to the
vector store for what is plain relational data: ``agent_deps.resolve_filter_values``
scrolls the collection 128 points at a time to collect artist names, and
``catalog_search_service`` reads a memoised full-collection scroll.
``track_metadata`` has all of it in one indexed table — and, unlike the scroll,
it hands over the release year in the same row, which is what the era filter
needs.

**Per-account gating is not uniform across these tables, and getting it wrong is
silent.** ``track_metadata`` has a composite primary key ``(collection_name,
track_id)``, so filtering it by ``collection_name`` is correct. ``songs`` and
``artists`` do NOT: their primary key is a global slug and ``collection_name`` is
one mutable column on it, which is exactly the bug ``fact_visibility`` was
created to fix — whichever account indexed a slug last used to steal every other
account's visibility. So those two are gated by joining ``fact_visibility``, and
never by their own ``collection_name`` column.

Matching is the part worth preserving from the previous assistant, so it is kept
exactly: exact on a folded, feat-stripped title key with an artist containment
check, then fuzzy with a strict similarity gate, and every result tagged
``exact`` / ``fuzzy`` / ``none``.
