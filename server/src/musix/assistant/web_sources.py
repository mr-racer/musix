"""Where results come from, and how a result is judged before it is downloaded.

Four sources, two very different treatments:

* **Wikipedia, Apple Music, Fandom** are searched with the host pinned. What comes
  back is trusted enough to fetch without a relevance pass — the host filter has
  already done the work a reranker would.
* **The open web** is pulled 20 deep and passed through the cross-encoder as
  ``title + snippet``. Only candidates above the threshold get downloaded. This is
  where the money is: fetching five pages costs seconds each, and the
  cross-encoder can tell in one batched forward pass which five are worth it.

What is NOT here: a hand-tuned authority table (billboard 2.8, pitchfork 2.4, …).
It was a static prior standing in for a relevance judgement we can now actually
make. The junk-URL blacklist stays — a Spotify or Instagram link is never the
answer, and dropping it costs nothing and saves a cross-encoder slot.

The HTTP call itself lives in ``resources.searxng_client``. Everything here is
policy on top of it: budgets, deduplication, spam, host takeover, and which host
to pin.
