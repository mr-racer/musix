"""Discovery cards for the assistant page — the "СВЯЗИ В БИБЛИОТЕКЕ" rail.

Every card is a hook that already knows what it will ask the assistant: tapping
one sends a turn, it does not navigate. Four kinds, all built from data the
code can verify against the DB:

0. ``samples`` — a track built from ≥ 2 sampled records («какие сэмплы в X?»).
   The other side does not have to be a library song: the count is a property
   of the track, and the assistant's answer resolves the details anyway.
1. ``relation`` — a sample / interpolation / cover where BOTH sides are songs
   of this library (two covers and an arrow). This one carries a ``fact``: the
   statement itself, echoed back as ``AssistantRequest.focus_fact`` so the
   assistant explains the link rather than reciting the track's whole dossier.
2. ``producer`` — a producer credited on N ≥ 3 tracks here.
3. ``artist`` — an artist whose biography is already generated, so the facts
   branch has something to answer with.

What is deliberately NOT here: lyric gems (mined findings turned out weak —
noise beats signal), ``lyrical_reference`` / ``inspiration`` / ``other`` links
(too uneven to state as fact), and raw fact text (``refined_facts`` has no
categories, so "interesting" cannot be filtered; a fact is a reason to ask, not
something to print). The rail shows no model-written prose at all.

Prompts are built here, in both languages — same rule as ``humanize``: the SPA
animates strings, it never composes them.
