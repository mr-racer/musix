"""One URL, one page — deciding when two links are the same thing.

Two search streams routinely return the same article, and SearXNG hands the same
Wikipedia page back in several spellings: percent-encoded and not
(``Taylor_Swift%E2%80%93Kanye_West_feud`` vs ``Taylor_Swift–Kanye_West_feud``),
with and without ``www.``, sometimes through the ``m.`` mobile mirror, often with
tracking parameters glued on.

Treating those as different pages is expensive twice over. It burns fetch slots
that are the slowest thing in the pipeline, and — worse, because it is silent —
it puts three copies of the same text into the retriever, where the duplicates
inflate the document frequencies BM25 depends on and crowd the top-k with the
same paragraph three times.

The canonical form is a KEY, never something to fetch. It drops the scheme and
lowercases the host, which is right for comparison and wrong for an HTTP request;
the original URL is always what goes over the wire.
