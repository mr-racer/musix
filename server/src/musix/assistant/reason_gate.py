"""Code gate over the per-track "why this fits" line of a built playlist.

The reason is written by the curate call of ``recsys_ai_service`` and only on
the library path (``clap_search`` / ``library_search`` / ``similar_tracks``) —
``web_hits`` hardcodes it to ``None`` because no curation happened there. The
prompt already forbids filler, but a 12b model obeys that unevenly, so the UI
never shows a reason this module has not cleared.

Dropping a reason is cheap: the card renders the track without a second line
and nothing looks broken. Showing "отличный трек" is what makes the whole
feature read as noise — hence code decides, not the model.

``recsys_ai_service`` itself stays untouched (the unified-assistant spec keeps
it frozen); the gate runs in the assistant layer on the way out.
