"""Finding the one Wikipedia article an artist bio should be written from.

Three checks, in order of cost, and the order is the design. The shape checks
are free and prove the page is an article. Language preference decides WHICH
article. The cross-encoder is a GATE, not the ranking — it removes the wrong
entity and nothing else.

That last distinction was learned the expensive way: sorting candidates by
cross-encoder score outright picked the French M83 article (0.87) over the
English one (0.44), because a snippet in the reader's own language scores
higher — which says nothing about which article is the better source.
