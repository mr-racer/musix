"""Where the passages come from — and how few requests that is allowed to cost.

Three requests per artist, and the shape of every one of them is the same:
ask an index, gate the candidates with the cross-encoder, download only what
survived, gate again on the body.

    WIKI  2 requests   batched title probe, then the relevance index
    WEB   1 request    the open web, only when Wikipedia yielded nothing usable

There used to be a second writer for the WEB case: an LLM agent with its own
SearXNG client, its own three searches, no cross-encoder and no junk filter.
It wrote 104 of the 580 production biographies, and none of them went through
any of the checks the Wikipedia path spent a release learning it needed. It is
gone. The web is a SOURCE now, not a second pipeline: what it returns is
chunked, gated and indexed exactly like an article, and everything downstream —
the five bio facets, the four fact facets, the script control — cannot tell the
two apart.
