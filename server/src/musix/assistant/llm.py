"""The LLM, spoken to in strict JSON and nothing else.

No tool calling anywhere in this package. This repository has been burned twice
by small models mangling tool-call syntax, and the branches that survive on a 12b
model all work the way this does: a fixed pipeline calls the model at known
points, the model returns one JSON object, and code decides what any of it means.

Two robustness measures on top of ``llm_client``, both cheap and both earned:

* **Extraction, not parsing.** Local models wrap JSON in prose, in ``` fences, or
  emit a reasoning preamble. ``llm_client.ask_llm(parse_json=True)`` strips a
  leading fence and then calls ``json.loads``, which raises on "Here is the plan:
  {...} Hope this helps!". The object is located in the text instead.
* **One repair round.** If extraction fails, the model is shown its own output and
  asked for the object alone. One, not a loop: a model that cannot produce JSON
  twice will not produce it on the fifth try, and every caller here has a
  deterministic fallback for exactly this.

The transport is ``llm_client``'s own cached ``AsyncOpenAI``, so instance
settings (DB > request > env) resolve exactly as they do everywhere else. What
this adds is a MESSAGE LIST — the repair round needs one, and ``ask_llm`` only
accepts a single user turn.
