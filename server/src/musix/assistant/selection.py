"""Claims → a playlist: weighting, filtering, triage, curation.

The stages between "pages said these songs exist" and "here is the playlist".

The division of labour is the same as everywhere else in this package. Code
decides what exists, how much each source is worth and what the era rules out.
The model gets exactly one judgement — which of the surviving tracks the page was
actually offering as an answer — and can express it only as a list of ids.

The per-track "why this fits" line goes through ``reason_gate.clean_reason``, the
same gate the old playlist path used: the prompt already forbids filler and a 12b
model obeys that unevenly.
