"""Where a run's time actually went.

Built to answer one question — what to optimise next — so every decision here
serves that and nothing else.

**Spans are flat.** A span never contains another span. Nesting would silently
double-count the inner one and the shares would still add up to something
plausible, which is the worst kind of wrong number: it looks like a measurement.
The guard is a depth counter that names both spans in a warning, and the
``unaccounted`` row goes negative when it happens, so a mistake is visible in the
report itself rather than only in a log nobody reads.

**Spans measure wall time, not CPU time.** ``fetch`` downloading eight pages
concurrently is one span of three seconds, not eight spans of three. That is what
the user waits for, and it keeps the shares summing to 100%. The cost is that
this cannot tell you a stage is under-parallelised — for that, compare its wall
time against how many items it handled.

**Nothing hides.** ``wall`` is measured around the whole run, and the difference
between it and the sum of the spans gets its own row. An instrumentation gap
shows up as a large ``unaccounted`` instead of as a stage that looks cheaper than
it is.
