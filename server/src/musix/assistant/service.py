"""Assistant orchestrator — one entry point over the deterministic web agent.

Owns no business logic. It builds the run's config out of the request, hands the
message to :class:`agent.Assistant`, and turns whichever of the four result
contracts comes back into the payload the route serves.

**The callback problem.** The pipeline reports progress from wherever it happens
to be: the LLM calls are on the event loop, but the whole search and fetch phase
runs inside ``asyncio.to_thread``. Feeding both into one stream naively either
drops the thread-borne events or lets them overtake the terminal ``result``.
:class:`EventSink` solves it the way ``routes/recommend.py`` already does — one
``asyncio.Queue`` plus ``loop.call_soon_threadsafe`` for anything arriving
off-loop.
