"""Hosts that are never an answer to a question about music.

A broken engine does not fail cleanly. It returns a page of adult-cam or casino
affiliate spam, SearXNG fuses that with the good engines' results by rank, and
the two interleave — one real link, one brothel, one real link. From inside the
pipeline the spam looks exactly like a search result: it has a title, a snippet
and a rank, so it survives to the cross-encoder, sometimes past it, and
occasionally into an answer.

Two rules, and the split matters:

**Hosts only, never titles or snippets.** "Casino" is an album, "Sex" is in a
hundred song titles, and a filter reading the text would delete real results
while a domain named ``stripchat.global`` sails past. The host is the part that
cannot be a coincidence.

**Distinctive substrings, exact labels for the rest.** ``porn`` and ``casino``
are safe to match anywhere in a host. ``bet`` and ``sex`` are not — they live
inside ``betterhelp.com``, ``arbeit.de`` and ``middlesex.gov.uk`` — so those
match only as a whole domain label.

The list is not meant to be complete. It is the cheap first cut; the per-engine
spam counter in ``web_sources`` is what actually identifies the engine to remove.
