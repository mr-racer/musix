"""Finding a song in the user's own library from words they remember.

Deterministic, shaped like the playlist branch: the planner produces two queries,
Qdrant produces candidates, the cross-encoder orders them, and the model gets one
job — say which of these is the song, and quote the line.

What is deliberately NOT reproduced from the previous engine: its four-attempt
loop with a validator that re-asks. That architecture is what this work exists to
leave. What IS reproduced, verbatim, are the parts of it that were right:

* resolving the model's free-text title back to a concrete hit through three
  passes, so "(Remastered)" does not lose the track;
* re-anchoring the highlight on the line the ANSWER quoted rather than on the
  executed query, because the two regularly disagree;
* shipping an empty hit list when the model named no song, so near-misses are
  never presented as an answer.

**Filtering happens here, not in Qdrant.** The vector store's artist filter is an
exact ``MatchValue`` on the payload, so a request for "Sade" would silently drop
every track tagged "Sade feat. …" — and «Канье» would match nothing at all. The
library catalog already knows how to compare names across spellings and
alphabets, so the pool is pulled deeper and narrowed here.
