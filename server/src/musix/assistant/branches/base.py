"""What the two web branches share: searching, fetching, chunking, ranking.

The context pack is built here, and the two rules it enforces are the reason
this is one place rather than two:

* **the threshold decides membership, not a count.** ``ce_threshold_chunks`` is
  the only thing that says a passage may be shown, and when nothing clears it the
  pack is empty — which the branch reads as "search again", never as "answer with
  what is left";
* **near-duplicates do not spend slots.** The pool is pulled deeper than the pack
  so that dropping a copy FREES a slot rather than shrinking the pack.
