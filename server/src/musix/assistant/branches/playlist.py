the claims are matched against the library, the sources are weighted and the era

# "Kanye West discography" is a disambiguation stub — three links, no table —
# while the songs live under "singles discography"; JAY-Z's are under "albums
# discography"; Sade's are on the plain "discography" page. A page that yields
# nothing is almost always the stub, so the next spelling is simply tried.
#
# Order is by usefulness for a PLAYLIST: singles and song lists are tracks, an
# albums table is albums. The albums page is last and its rows arrive labelled

        was retyping rows that parse in milliseconds.

        A parser that comes back empty hands the page to the prose lane rather
