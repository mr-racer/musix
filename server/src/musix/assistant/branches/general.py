"""Questions about an artist, a song or an incident — and the tap-through modes.

Control flow is fixed. The model is called at known points — plan (before this
branch), answer, next queries — and everything between those calls is code.
There is no loop the model can steer and no place where "should I keep going?"
is settled by prose.

**The library answers first.** Iteration 0 builds a pack out of SQLite alone
(``local_pack``): the subject's facts, the facts of the songs it is
structurally tied to, its sample links, credits and gems — plus any passages a
previous turn already downloaded. If the model says that answers the question,
the run ends there and nothing is fetched. The web is what happens when the
library came up short, not the first thing tried.

The one judgement genuinely left to the model is whether the question came out
answered. Code cannot read a passage and know that it explains the origin of a
stage name. But code CAN see the cross-encoder probabilities the model never
sees, and it holds the veto in both directions:

* model says "enough" while the best chunk scored below the threshold → another
  iteration runs anyway;
* model says "not enough" while the budget is spent, or the last round brought no
  new material → the run ends and answers with what it has.

The local iteration is judged against its own threshold. Fact probabilities live
on the ``ce_threshold_facts`` scale, not the chunk one, so measuring them against
``weak_context_prob`` would send every local iteration to the web and quietly
undo the whole thing. Structural items carry no probability at all and are judged
on ``sufficient`` alone — they are facts ABOUT the subject, not candidates FOR
it, and scoring them would answer a question nobody asked.

Grounding: a numbered pack, an answer that must cite numbers, and code that
throws the answer away when the citations do not check out. An unnumbered
paragraph physically cannot reach the caller.
