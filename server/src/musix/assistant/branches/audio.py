"""Finding tracks by how they SOUND: CLAP text→audio, four angles, RRF.

The LLM is called twice and neither call is a judgement. The planner turned the
sentence into an intent and a set of filters; this branch asks it once more to
rewrite the user's description of sound into CLAP's own dialect, and then does
arithmetic. There is nothing here for a model to validate — the vector store
already answered — so the caption is written by code and no third call is made.

Why four rephrasings rather than one: a single prompt is one lucky or unlucky
point in CLAP's text space, and its top-10 swings hard on wording that means the
same thing to a human. Four prompts that differ only in which acoustic parameter
they emphasise, merged by reciprocal rank, turn "whatever this phrasing happened
to retrieve" into "what every phrasing agreed on".

The artist never enters the prompt text. It is doing its work as a filter, where
it is exact and free; inside a CLAP prompt it is noise that drags the vector
towards whatever that artist's most typical track sounds like.
