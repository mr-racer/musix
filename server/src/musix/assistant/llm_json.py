"""Tolerant JSON-object extraction from a small model's reply.

Every assistant prompt asks for one minified object and nothing else, and a 12b
model obeys that most of the time — but not deterministically. The same question
comes back as a bare object one run, wrapped in a code fence the next, and
preceded by one polite sentence the run after that. ``ask_llm(parse_json=True)``
raises on all but the first shape, which is why the assistant branches take the
raw text and dig the object out here instead.

Returning ``None`` is a normal outcome: the caller's verification gate then
rejects the answer exactly as it rejects a malformed one, which is the safe
path in both cases.
