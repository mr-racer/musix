"""Every knob of the assistant, in one place, at the top of one file.

These are the numbers to turn. They were set against real runs rather than
reasoned out, and the comment on each says what it is defending against — read
it before moving one, because most of them are guarding a specific failure that
is invisible once it comes back.

Endpoints are NOT here. The LLM address, model and key are resolved per request
through ``llm_client`` (instance settings > request body > env) and SearXNG's
address through ``resources.searxng_client``; duplicating them would create a

# Three of them, because they are three different decisions over three different

# DOCUMENTS: "is this page worth downloading?", judged on a title and a two-line
# snippet. Cheap to be wrong in either direction — a bad page costs one fetch, a
# missed page costs the answer — so the bar is low.
CE_THRESHOLD_DOCS = 0.35
# CHUNKS: "does this passage go in front of the model?". Expensive to be wrong: a
