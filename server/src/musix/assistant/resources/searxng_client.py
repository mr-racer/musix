"""The raw SearXNG call, paced and diagnosed.

This wraps the search instance and nothing else: one HTTP request, the whole
JSON body, and the rate limiting the instance needs to keep working. Every
policy decision on top of it — which engines, what counts as spam, when one host
has taken over the results — lives in the service that calls this.

**Why the whole body and not just ``results``.** ``unresponsive_engines`` is
where the diagnosis lives. Without it, "DuckDuckGo timed out and this answer was
assembled by three fallbacks" is invisible from inside and shows up only as "the
results got worse".

**Why the pacing.** One assistant iteration fires up to eight searches, each
fanning out to every engine in the whitelist — roughly 50 outbound requests from
one IP in a couple of seconds. DuckDuckGo and Brave rate-limit that immediately,
SearXNG reads the timeout as a failure and suspends the engine for up to
``max_ban_time_on_fail``, and the rest of the run gets served by whatever fringe
engines are left. That is the mechanism behind a Kanye query coming back with
Indonesian journal PDFs.

The gate is process-global and the wait is real (unlike Reddit's, which skips):
a search is on the critical path of every branch, so skipping it would mean
answering without having looked, while a second of spacing is the cost of the
engines answering at all. It is a blocking sleep, so callers must be on a worker
thread — which they are, the whole search phase runs through ``to_thread``.

SearXNG is always a LOCAL service (the Compose network, or a port on the host),
so nothing here is ever proxied.
