"""Getting readable text out of an arbitrary web page.

Two orthogonal halves, deliberately separate: a **fetcher cascade** that returns
HTML and an **extractor** that turns HTML into markdown. They do not know about
each other — the body from ``curl_cffi`` is parsed by exactly the same extractor
as a body from anywhere else — which is what lets a page be fetched one way and
read another (the MediaWiki API path and the Reddit feed path both hand their
HTML to the same extractor).

**Why trafilatura is not in the cascade.** It ships a perfectly good downloader,
and upstream in the lab it was the first fetcher tried. It cannot be used here:
``trafilatura.fetch_url`` builds its own ``urllib3.PoolManager``, and a
``PoolManager`` — unlike a ``ProxyManager`` — does not read proxy environment
variables. This deployment routes external outbound through ``HTTP_PROXY`` read
out of ``.env`` (docker-compose blanks it in the process environment on purpose,
so internal traffic stays direct), and there is no per-call way to hand that to
trafilatura. Its own fetcher is urllib3 with a User-Agent, i.e. roughly what
``curl_plain`` already does, so nothing is lost by keeping trafilatura as the
extractor alone and letting curl do the downloading.

Nothing here reads configuration. The proxy arrives as an argument, because a
resource that reaches into the settings layer is a resource you cannot test.
