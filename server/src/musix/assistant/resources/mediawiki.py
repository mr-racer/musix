"""Reading a wiki through its API instead of scraping the page.

Fandom sits behind a Cloudflare interstitial. Every plain HTTP fetcher gets the
same 403 "Just a moment…" page — measured on
``testdrive.fandom.com/wiki/Test_Drive_Unlimited_2/Soundtrack``: bare httpx, a
browser User-Agent and a full browser header set all failed identically, as did
``?action=raw`` and ``Special:Export``. A spoofed TLS fingerprint gets through
sometimes and stops working when Cloudflare tightens; it is not something to
build a pipeline on.

``api.php?action=parse`` is not behind the interstitial. It answers 200 with the
article's rendered HTML.

It is NOT used everywhere, though. On Wikipedia the ordinary fetch is both
faster and cleaner: the API hands back the whole raw article — every navbox,
infobox and collapsed table — where trafilatura's extraction returns half the
characters and better ones (measured on the Kanye West singles discography:
120k from the API against 57k extracted). So the API is the primary path only
for hosts where scraping does not work, and the fallback everywhere else.

What this does NOT do is authenticate, edit, or read anything a logged-out
visitor could not. It is the same article, fetched the way the software offers
it.
