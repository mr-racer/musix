"""Reading a Reddit thread when Reddit will not serve the page.

Every ordinary route into a thread is closed from a blocked IP, and each is
closed in its own way. The HTML page renders in JavaScript, so httpx, requests
and urllib all come back with an 8 KB shell holding no post and no comments.
``curl_cffi`` with a browser fingerprint gets past that and lands on a 167 KB
"Prove your humanity" interstitial — served with status 200, which is why
``web_fetch.looks_like_a_bot_wall`` exists. Every ``.json`` endpoint — ``www``,
``old``, ``api.reddit.com`` — answers 403 to every transport.

The Atom feed still works. It is the same public thread in the format Reddit
publishes for feed readers: no JavaScript to run, no bot wall in front of it, no
credentials. Append ``.rss`` to the thread URL and the post arrives as the first
entry with the comments after it.

**Pacing is the whole difficulty, and it is why this never waits.** Measured
against a real thread: a burst earns a 403, it lifts after about a minute, and
one request per minute then succeeds indefinitely. In the lab that was a
``time.sleep`` in front of the request, which is right for a notebook and wrong
for a server: a user's question would sit for a minute inside a worker thread on
the chance that a comment thread helps. Here the cooldown is a **gate, not a
wait** — if it has not elapsed, the read is skipped and the caller moves on.
Reddit is a parachute that only deploys when nothing else answered, so a skip
means "the parachute did not open", never "the request hung".

The gate is process-global because Reddit rate-limits per IP: two fetchers in
one process share one budget whether they know it or not.

There is no retry, for the same reason there is no wait.
