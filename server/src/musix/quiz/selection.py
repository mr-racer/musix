"""Answer-track selection: familiarity, skill, and the adaptive band.

Difficulty adapts on how often the listener actually plays a track, not on how
obscure the track is in general. The quiz is about *your own* collection, so
your play history is the only honest difficulty knob available — and the one
the listener recognises when it moves.

Everything here is a pure function over plain dicts. Nothing touches Qdrant,
SQLite or the clock, which is what makes the difficulty curve testable rather
than something you can only judge by playing it.
