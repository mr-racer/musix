"""Distractor selection — the false options in a round.

Two problems are solved here, and they pull in opposite directions.

The first is that CLAP over-weights vocals: a track's nearest neighbours in
CLAP space are overwhelmingly the same performer or the same record, so a slate
built from "the three closest" gives the answer away by elimination. Hence the
hard exclusion in :func:`shares_artist_or_album` (invariant I-3), applied
before any ranking, and distance measured in the six-dimensional sonic-axis
space rather than over the raw 512-dimensional vector. The axes are CLAP
projected onto interpretable poles, and voice identity dissolves in them —
``vocal_lead`` says "vocals lead", not "same voice".

The second is that a slate of three near-identical tracks is a coin flip. So
the slate is deliberately mixed: one genuinely confusable neighbour, one
era-and-genre match that sounds different, one familiar track. The player
should finish a round feeling they reasoned, not that they guessed.
