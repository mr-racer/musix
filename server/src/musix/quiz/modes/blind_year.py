"""M3 «Слепой год» — name the release year from the sound.

The scoring is the design. A year sits on a line, so binary right/wrong makes
missing by one feel exactly like missing by twenty — which is both untrue and
discouraging, and it throws away the only interesting signal the mode produces.
Partial credit turns the round into a calibration reading: over a few dozen
answers you learn which decades you actually hear.

Spec: docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-21-music-quiz-design.md §7 M3.
