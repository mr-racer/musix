"""M1 "What's playing" — the main mode.

A snippet plays; the listener picks the track from four options. This is the
only mode with adaptive difficulty, and the difficulty comes from *how often
you actually play a track*, not from how short the snippet is. Shrinking the
clip is the cheap way to make a music quiz hard and it makes it annoying
instead; reaching further down your own tail makes it hard and interesting.
