"""M2 «Почерк продюсера» — three tracks share a producer, one does not.

The constraints are the mode, not decoration around it. Three tracks by one
producer off one album is not a discovery, it is the definition of an album;
three by one artist asks about the artist rather than about the production.
Strip either constraint and the round can be won without hearing a thing.

The audio works differently from the recognition modes. There is no single
snippet, because the round is four records rather than one: each option plays
its own five seconds, taken a third of the way in where the production shows
rather than at a point chosen to make the track recognisable. Covers stay
visible here too — this mode asks who shaped a sound, not what the track is,
and hiding art buys nothing.

Spec: docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-21-music-quiz-design.md §7 M2.
