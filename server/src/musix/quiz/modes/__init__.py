"""Mode registry — built from an explicit import list, on purpose.

v1's ``app.services.ai_tasks`` registered its members as a side effect of being
imported, and that has broken silently once already: drop the seemingly unused
``import ai_tasks`` from ``main.py`` and the endpoint starts answering HTTP 400
with nothing in the logs and every unit test still green (CLAUDE.md, invariant
3). Registering here by explicit assignment means a missing mode is an
ImportError at startup, not a mystery at runtime — and an integration test
asserts ``GET /quiz/modes`` returns every key, because that is the failure
class unit tests cannot see.
