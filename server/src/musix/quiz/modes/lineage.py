"""M4 «Родословная» — which record was this track built on?

This mode teaches more than it tests. Most listeners cannot answer it cold, and
that is fine: the reveal is the payload, and a wrong guess still leaves you
knowing where a song you love came from.

Its one hard constraint: a distractor must not itself be a source of the same
track. A round with two true answers is broken, not hard — and tracks with
several credited samples are exactly the ones this mode likes to pick.

Sample coverage runs around a quarter of a library, so this mode leans hardest
on the I-5 pool gate: on a small collection it simply never appears.
