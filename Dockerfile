# ── Stage 1: build the Vite frontend ────────────────────────────────────────

# here and copy only the built dist/ into the runtime image — Node and
# node_modules never reach the final image.

# Base: PyTorch CUDA runtime already ships torch 2.6.0+cu124 (+torchvision /
# torchaudio), so `pip install -r requirements.txt` reuses those wheels instead
# of re-downloading ~2.5 GB from the PyTorch index.

#   libmagic1   — MIME sniff for uploads (python-magic)
#   libsndfile1 — librosa / soundfile audio feature extraction
#   git         — a few pip packages build from git
